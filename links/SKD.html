    <b><h3>Ingredients</h3></b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small bunch stemmed kale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 cooked breakfast sausage links</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b><h3>Directions <em>(step-by-step)</em></h3></b>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pot of lightly salted water over high heat and bring to a brisk boil. Add kale and boil until leaves just start to get tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Place kale into a bowl of cold water, then drain. Gently squeeze out as much excess water as possible and roughly chop kale; set kale aside. You will need about 1/2 cup of chopped kale.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage links until browned, 2 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Use butter and fat from cooking to grease two 9-ounce baking dishes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, eggs, maple syrup, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a bowl. Whisk until flour disappears. Pour in milk and whisk to combine. Stir in about 1/2 cup chopped kale and mix in with a fork.</li>
        <li>Ladle mixture into prepared baking dishes - the depth of the batter needs to be about 1/2 inch deep. Place sausage links on top of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Place dishes in the center of a cold oven. Turn heat to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and leave in for about 25 minutes. Remove and serve.</li>
